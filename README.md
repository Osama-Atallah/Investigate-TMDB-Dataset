# Movie Popularity

This project is one of the projects submitted and connected with Udacity - Advanced Data Analysis Nanodegree.

## Introduction
For my final project in this course, I will conduct my own data analysis. Starting by taking a look at the dataset and brainstorming what questions I could answer using it. I will share my findings inside the notebook.This project is open-ended.

## Step One - Choose a Data Set
My choice: **A modified version of The Movie DataBase (TMDB) dataset.**

## Step Two - Analyze Data
Brainstorm some questions I could answer using the data set I chose, then start answering those questions.

My main analysis question is: **What makes some movies more popular than others?**

Try and suggest questions that promote looking at relationships between multiple variables.

## Step Three - Share My Findings
I will create a report that shares the findings I found most interesting. I will share my findings alongside the code  used to perform the analysis. Then I will save a copy of the notebook as an HTML file so that it can be opened easily.
