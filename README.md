# Movie Popularity

This project is one of the projects submitted and connected with Udacity - Advanced Data Analysis Nanodegree.

## Introduction
For my final project in this course, I will conduct my own data analysis. Starting by taking a look at the dataset and brainstorming what questions I could answer using it. I will share my findings inside the notebook.This project is open-ended.

## Step One - Choose a Data Set
My choice: **A modified version of The Movie DataBase (TMDB) dataset.**

## Step Two - Analyze Data
Brainstorm some questions I could answer using the data set I chose, then start answering those questions.

My main analysis question is: 
### What makes some movies more popular than others?

### Investigation Questions :
- What is the disribution of popularity?  
- Is it different in from a time era to another?
- How is the number of released movies changed over time?
- Does popularity correlate with number of released movies per year?
- Do famous category movies tend to get higher score by the audience more than movies with lower popularity categories?

## Step Three My Findings

- The distribution of popularity is strongly right skewed
- The biggest share of most popular movie are released between years 2010 and 2015
- The number of the released movies increases exponetialy with time,
- Most of the movies in the TMDB are released from year 2000 to year 2015.
- No correlattion found between popularity and the number of released movies per year.
- Very popular movies tend to get higher score by the audience than movies with lower popularity.<br>
<br>**Movies that are produced recently tend to be more popular than older ones**

## Step Four - Share My Findings
I will share my findings alongside the code I used to perform the analysis. Then I will save a copy of the notebook as an HTML file so that it can be opened easily.
